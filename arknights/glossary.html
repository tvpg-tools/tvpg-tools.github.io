                            <em>Melee</em> operators are those who can be placed on "low" tiles, and typically engage
                            the enemy via blocking. Melee enemies can only attack operators that they are blocked by.
                        </p>

                            targeted Objective. <em>Marksmen Snipers</em>, for example, will prioritize <em>Aerial</em>
                            enemies, even if there is a melee enemy (in range) about to enter the Objective.
                            <br>
                            <em>Ranged</em> enemies will attack <em>the most recently deployed</em> operator within

                            <dfn>LMD</dfn>.
                            <em>Tags</em> can be used to increase the chance of acquiring certain operators.

                            A special ability that can be used by an operator. Most skills require SP to activate.
                            There are three ways in which skills are activated:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Auto: Activates immediately upon the requisite number of SP being
                                acquired.</li>
                            <li>Manual: Activated at the player's discretion once enough SP have been acquired.</li>
                            <li>Passive: Activates when the operator is deployed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h5>Skill Point (SP)</h5>

                            ways:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span class="badge" style="background-color: limegreen;">Auto</span>

                                rate
                                of 1 per
                                second.</li>

                                attacks.</li>
                            <li><span class="badge" style="background-color: orange;">Defensive</span> Gained every
                                time

                                operator is
